myMovies

The complete server-side of your web application will consist of a well-designed REST API and
architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
(CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
way.

Whenever users of myMovies are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like
to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
list of “Favorite Movies.”

Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies,
directors, and genres. The server-side of the myMovies application will ensure they have access
to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
stored.
