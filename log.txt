It’s always good practice to have a log of recent requests made to your server. 
This can be helpful in so many ways, for instance, it can be used to debug your code, 
track the most visited URLs, and more. Go ahead and create an empty text file (e.g., “log.txt”) 
in your project folder. You’ll be populating this file dynamically through the code.

fs.appendFile('log.txt', 'URL: ' + addr + '\nTimestamp: ' + new Date() + '\n\n', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      console.log('Added to log.');
    }
  });
